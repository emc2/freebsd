.Dt TRUST-CONFIG 7
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm trust-config
.Nd "trust system configuration"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The trust system configuration the contents of the trust root set and
provides the trusted signing keys, allowing users to create signed
executables (see
.Xr signed-elf 5)
as well as other signed assets.  It provides the default keys to
.Xr signelf 8
and other utilities, and controls which keys are included in critical
system components as the builtin trust root set.
.Sh TERMINOLOGY
The trust configuration controls the behavior of a system consisting
of several parts with interlocking functions; thus, it is essential to
be clear about the terminology used to describe both the system and
its configuration.
.Ss Trust Root Set
The
.Sy trust root set
is a set of public (verification) keys which are built directly in to
critical system components.  The trust root set is then used to verify
intermediate certificates, revocation lists, signed executables, and
other signed assets.
.Pp
System components such as the kernel and
.Xr loader 8
which play an essential role in the chain of custody from boot to user
must necessarily include the trust root set into their binaries (which
are presumably verified by earlier boot stages or stored in flash
memory).  The build process must therefore collect a set of desired
keys and build them into these components.  The
.Sy trust root configuration
is the set of keys and additional information that controls this
aspect of the build process.
.Ss Trusted Signing Keys
The
.Sy trusted signing keys
are a set of private keys that correspond to public keys in the trust
root set.  These are used to produce signatures for various assets
that can be verified by the trust root set.
.Ss Trust System Configuration
The
.Sy trust system configuration
is the combination of the trust root configuration and the trusted
signing keys.
.Sh FILES
The trust system configuration consists of the following files and
directories:
.Bl -bullet indent
.It
.Pa /etc/trust/ :
The base directory for the trust system configuration
.It
.Pa /etc/trust/certs/ :
The directory containing the trust root configuration
.It
.Pa /etc/trust/priv/ :
The directory containing the trusted signing keys
.El
.Pp
The trusted signing key directory
.Pa /etc/trust/priv/
contains PEM-encoded private keys or PKCS#8 data structures.  The
standard file naming convention for a key named
.Qq mykey
is
.Pa mykey.pem .
.Pp
The trust root configuration directory
.Pa /etc/trust/certs/
contains PEM-encoded X509 certificates, and is generally compatible
with OpenSSL CA directory parameters or configuration options.  These
will typically be self-signed certificates, though nothing prevents
the inclusion of certificates signed by a third party.  Note, however,
that signatures on trust root keys are ignored by all trust system
components.
.Pp
Some public key certificates in the trust root configuration directory
correspond to signing keys in
.Pa /etc/trust/priv ;
the standard file naming convention for a certificate corresponding to
a private key named
.Qq mykey
(whose filename would be
.Pa mykey.pem )
is
.Pa mykey.pub.pem .
.Ss Third-Party Trust Keys
It is not required that all public key certificates in the trust root
configuration have a corresponding trusted signing key (with one
exception; see below).  There are many circumstances in which this may
be desirable, such as administration of large networks or distribution
of pre-built binaries from a trusted source.  Public-key certificates
in the trust root configuration without a corresponding trusted
signing key are known as
.Qq third-party keys .
.Pp
It is important to consider the security implications of third-party
keys before accepting such a key into a trust root configuration.
Because of the severity of these implications, there is no requirement
that any configuration include any third-party key(s), nor will there
ever be such a requirement.
.Pp
Furthermore, the
.Xr signelf 5
utility is perfectly capable of overwriting signatures from
third-party keys with a signature generated by a locally-controlled
keypair; thus, assets signed by a third party can easily be inspected
and re-signed locally at the behest of the system administrator.
.Ss Local Keypair
The key name
.Qq local
(which corresponds to the private key path
.Pa /etc/trust/priv/local.pem
and the public key path
.Pa /etc/trust/certs/local.pub.pem
by the file naming conventions) is used as the default keypair by
tools such as
.Xr signelf 8 .
This keypair is known as the
.Ar local keypair ,
should be generated locally on each installation, and should generally
not be exported to other installations.  Most user-oriented systems
and all systems that build the base system or packages locally for
their own use should have a local keypair.
.Pp
It is possible for some installations to lack a local keypair,
particularly on infrastructure-type systems that are set up using
standardized images or configuration management systems.  Such systems
generally do not build anything locally and rely on pre-built packages
for installation and upgrades.x
.Pp
However, it is an illegal configuration for there to be a public key
certificate named
.Pa /etc/trust/certs/local.pub.pem
without a corresponding private key.
.Sh DEFAULT
The default trust system configuration consists solely of a local
keypair which is generated during OS installation.  Any additional
trusted keys (including third-party keys) are signed by the local
keypair and loaded as intermediate keys rather than being added
directly to the trust root configuration.  This is the preferred
configuration, and alternatives should only be used if there is a
specific and compelling reason to do so.
